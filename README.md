# Energy Efficiency of Buildings: The Foundation of Our Sustainable Future

Today, with the increasing environmental consciousness, the concept of energy efficiency has become the focal point not only for individual consumers but also for corporate and industrial sectors. Especially, the importance given to energy efficiency in the design and operation of buildings is steadily increasing. This is because the energy consumption of buildings constitutes a significant portion of total energy usage, leading to depletion of natural resources and environmental impacts.

Energy efficiency is closely related not only to how much energy a building consumes but also to how effectively that energy is utilized. Traditional buildings are often structures that waste energy; inefficient usage of systems such as heating, cooling, lighting, and inadequate insulation can lead to energy losses. This situation can not only be environmentally detrimental but also lead to increased costs economically.

However, energy efficiency should not only focus on environmental and economic dimensions; social dimensions are also important. More energy-efficient buildings can enhance indoor comfort and elevate users' quality of life.

At this point, I tackled the issue of a building's energy efficiency by developing an end-to-end data science project using a dataset consisting of 768 buildings provided by Ecotect, obtaining training, validation, and test datasets.
